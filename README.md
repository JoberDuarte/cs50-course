# CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

Hey everyone! Here you'll find my solutions to the challenges from Harvard University's **CS50: Introduction to Computer Science** course (2024).

## About this Repository

I created this repository to show my progress in the course and share my solutions to the assignments. You can access all the course materials [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/)

## Purpose

The idea is to provide examples and practical solutions to help other students better understand the concepts covered in CS50. If you find this repository useful, feel free to take a look and leave your feedback.

## Disclaimer

Donâ€™t just copy the code mindlessly! Try to solve the problems on your own. If you really want to learn how to code, this is super important. Plus, copying like that would be a violation of the course's [Academic Honesty policy.](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/honesty/)

Good luck and happy studying!
