                <h2>JOBER DUARTE</h2>
                <p> Hello, my name is Jober, I am 33 years old, and I am currently transitioning into a new career.
                    I presently work in the financial market, trading derivatives. However, in my daily work, Iâ€™ve noticed that high-frequency trading (HFT) firms are increasingly capturing market share, taking over the portion that used to belong to arbitrage traders.</p>
                <p>This observation led me to start researching programming, and soon I discovered this fascinating world, which captivated me completely.</p>
                <p>As a result, I decided that I needed to learn programming and immerse myself in this universe. I committed to dedicating time every day to improve my skills and knowledge in this area.</p>
                <p>To achieve this, I created a daily routine that allows me to balance my current responsibilities with my programming studies.</p>
