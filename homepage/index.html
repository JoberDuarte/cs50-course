                <h2>JOBER DUARTE</h2>
                <p> Hello, my name is Jober, I am 33 years old, and at the moment, I am undergoing a career transition.
                    I currently work in the financial market, trading derivatives. However, in my daily routine, I have noticed how some HFTs are gaining more and more market share, taking over the portion that used to belong to arbitrage traders.

                    Given this, I started researching programming, and thatâ€™s when I discovered this world, which I found captivating and fascinating.

                    So, I decided that I needed to learn programming and dive deeper into this world, dedicating myself to learning:

                    For this, I created a routine that would allow me to balance everything I need to do during the day while adding a few hours of daily programming study.</p>
