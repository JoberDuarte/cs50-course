                    <h2>TENIS</h2>
                    <p> Tennis has always been my passion, as you can see from the photo. The man in the picture is Gustavo Kuerten, the greatest Brazilian tennis player I've had the privilege of watching. I started playing 10 years ago and, even after all this time, I still consider myself an average player. Tennis seems easy to watch, but it requires a lot of technique and coordination. In my first few years, I barely knew how to hold a racket correctly.</p>
                    <p>It's like a dance: every part of your body needs to work in harmony for the ball to be directed with precision. Unfortunately, a left shoulder injury kept me off the courts in March 2024. The pain was intense and prevented me from playing.</p>
                    <p>One of the most memorable moments of my life as a tennis fan was watching the 2017 ATP Finals in London and seeing Roger Federer play live. The perfection with which he executed every stroke was inspiring.</p>
                    <p>TAlthough I don't play anymore, tennis continues to be a big part of my life. I follow the tournaments and am inspired by the great athletes.</p>
